# LEAFLETS

Leaflets is my solo final project for Flatiron School. The houseplant industry has exploded in the past year and in order to be a successful plant parent there are a lot of different factors to keep track of: water, light, humidity, soil, temperature, etc. The goal of Leaflets is to cultivate better plant care habits, by making it easier to keep a record of your plant.  

## Tech
Leaflets was built with a React front end and a Rails API backend.

## Installation
1. Clone both this repository and [this](https://github.com/beendra/leaflets-back) repository.
2. Run npm install on the front end and bundle install on the backend.
3. Start the front end with 'npm start'
4. Start the back end with 'rails s -p 4000'
5. To Use:
    - Sign Up and Login
    - Navigate to Plants and Click Add Plant to creat a new plant
    - Click Logs and then Add Log to write a log for you plant
    - You can Edit or Delete both your logs and plants
    - Information on the plants in the database are on the 'Guides' page

## Future Plans
I would like to continue to grow this application and concept in several ways. I would like to make the Database more dynamic, possibly creating my own house plant API. I would also like to add a photo upload feature as well and also make the web app into a mobile application. Once these are accomplished I would like to officially deploy the app for use. 

## Credits
Thank you to my cohort at Flatiron and all of the instructors, coaches, and faculty who made this such a great experience.
